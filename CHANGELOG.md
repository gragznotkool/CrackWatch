---

## v3.6.3 — Comprehensive README for GitHub
- Replaced Vite template README with a complete project documentation
- Includes: 30-second pitch, feature table by platform, architecture diagram, complete tech stack, full API reference, setup instructions, demo credentials, WhatsApp bot setup, key design decisions with expandable sections, performance metrics, roadmap, security notes
- Hero banner with badges (version, license, Python, React, FastAPI, NIRMAN, Problem #4)
- One-line pitch prominently displayed: "Detecting a pothole doesn't fix it. A watched government does."

## v3.6.2 — Wall of Shame: region-based contractor mapping
- Added 4 new mock contractors: South Mumbai Roadworks, Western Suburbs Builders, Eastern Suburbs Contractor, CIDCO Infrastructure
- Expanded area→contractor keyword mapping: 30+ Mumbai / Navi Mumbai location keywords (Marine Drive, Bandra, Andheri, Chembur, Vashi, Kharghar, Panvel, etc.)
- Wall of Shame now ranks 6 contractors (was 2) — realistic accountability showcase
- Each contractor gets ~3-12 reports spread across their zone, with varied fix rates and negligence scores

## v3.6.1 — Real AI-detected demo reports across Mumbai + Navi Mumbai
- Added backend/seed_from_images.py — reads images from any folder, runs full AI detection, generates N demo reports
- Replaced 8 hardcoded fake demo reports with 20 real image-based reports
- Each report has annotated_image from YOLO detection + real severity + real cost estimate
- Distributed across 20 landmarks: 10 Mumbai (Marine Drive, Sea Link, Dadar, Andheri, BKC, etc.) + 10 Navi Mumbai (Vashi, Nerul, Belapur, Kharghar, Panvel, etc.)
- Status mix: 9 submitted, 5 in_progress, 3 acknowledged, 3 fixed (for realistic dashboard variety)
- Reporter variety, realistic timestamps spread across 14 days, upvote counts scaled by severity
- Startup flow: loads from shared_store.json if present, else falls back to legacy 8-report seed

## v3.6.0 — Presentation rebuilt: 15-slide deck with all groundbreaking features
- Completely rewrote presentation/generate.cjs with Sovereign Intelligence dark theme
- Expanded from 12 slides to 15, adding the missing groundbreaking features
- NEW slide 5: WhatsApp Bot — showstopper with conversation mockup, "500M users" stat
- NEW slide 8: 5-Layer Fraud Detection — image authenticity, GPS, relevance, duplicates, rate limiting
- NEW slide 9: Predictive Maintenance — "fails in 18 days" card + monsoon acceleration factor
- NEW slide 10: Gamification — Pothole Hunter podium visual + 6 feature cards
- NEW slide 11: Wall of Shame + Accountability Loop — contractor negligence ranking
- Upgraded visual design: cards with borders, gradient callouts, colored tag system
- Switched layout from 10x7.5 to widescreen 13.33x7.5
- Color palette: emerald primary, cyan/violet/amber/gold accents, dark cards on black
- Fixed hex+alpha color warnings (now uses transparency property)

## v3.5.2 — Stateful WhatsApp bot: two-step photo + location flow
- Problem: WhatsApp strips EXIF GPS from photos for privacy, so all WhatsApp reports defaulted to Mumbai center coords
- Fix: turned webhook into a two-step conversation
  1. User sends photo → AI detection runs → bot replies with preview and asks for 📎 → Location
  2. User shares WhatsApp location → report finalized with real GPS
- whatsapp_sessions dict now tracks pending_photo per phone number
- Pending photo expires after 15 minutes (prevents stale photo + fresh location mismatch)
- If EXIF GPS is somehow preserved (rare), skips the location-ask and finalizes immediately
- Reply labels the GPS source: "from WhatsApp location share" / "from photo GPS" / "default Mumbai"
- New helper: _finalize_whatsapp_report(phone, reporter, lat, lng, pending, loc_source)
- Refactored welcome + no-damage messages into module constants

## v3.5.1 — Shared file store for cross-process report sync
- Problem: WhatsApp webhook backend (port 8001 HTTP, for ngrok) and frontend backend (port 8000 HTTPS) run as separate processes with isolated in-memory state → WhatsApp reports didn't appear on govt dashboard
- Fix: added shared_store.json file at backend/ that both processes merge with
- Writes (`/public/report`, `/whatsapp/webhook`) call `_persist_shared_store()` after citizen_reports.append
- Reads (`/admin/reports/map`, `/public/reports/map`, `/public/reports/map/detail`) call `_reload_shared_store()` first
- Dedupe by id, latest file state wins on conflict
- shared_store.json added to .gitignore (ephemeral, regenerates on startup)

## v3.5.0 — WhatsApp reporting bot (Twilio Sandbox)
- New endpoint: POST /whatsapp/webhook (Twilio WhatsApp incoming-message webhook)
- Citizens send a photo via WhatsApp to Twilio sandbox number (+1 415 523 8886)
- Backend downloads media from Twilio (auth-protected), extracts GPS from EXIF if present, runs full AI detection pipeline
- Reuses existing detection, severity, cost, gamification logic
- No-damage guard (v3.4.0 threshold) applied — weak detections reply with tips instead of creating a ghost report
- Reply includes: report ID, damage type with severity+confidence, estimated cost, repair method, GPS, XP/coins earned
- Session state tracked per phone number (whatsapp_sessions dict)
- Added dependencies: twilio 9.3, python-dotenv 1.0, httpx 0.27
- Credentials stored in gitignored backend/.env
- .gitignore: added `.env.*` pattern to cover future env variants

## v3.4.0 — Reject reports with no detectable damage
- Backend /public/report: confidence threshold 0.20 → 0.30 (reduces false positives from textures/noise)
- Added early-exit: if no detection ≥ 0.35 confidence, return `status: "no_damage"` without creating a report
- Response includes annotated_image, max_confidence, and tips for better photos
- Public app: new `no_damage` screen with blue friendly alert, annotated preview, confidence score, photography tips, "Try Another Photo" button
- Fixes: clean photos (selfies, cats, plain walls) no longer auto-approved as genuine damage reports

## v3.3.14 — Login page: tone down spacing (v3.3.13 was too spacey)

- Consistent visual rhythm between fields

## v3.3.13 — Login page: force spacing via inline styles

- Label margin: mb-2.5 → mb-3
- Error message: added mb-4 when visible

## v3.3.11 — Login page: center logo + more padding between fields
- Logo+title wrapper now uses flex flex-col items-center (explicit horizontal centering — mx-auto wasn't working reliably inside the phone frame)
- Form wrapper also centered with flex flex-col items-center
- Fields gap: space-y-4 → space-y-6 (24px instead of 16px between Name and Password)
- Label bottom margin: mb-2 → mb-2.5
- Submit button: added mt-2 to push it off the password field

## v3.3.10 — De-clutter Rewards page (profile + achievements)
